## Overview

In this project, I've built a `Country Quiz` app. First thing I did was to create index.html and added a `script` tag to link the code. Second step was creating an index.js which will hold the my `App.js` file. That App.js has all my two components linked, which are `QuizData` that has the questions and the `QuizResult` has the results. 

-  You can see my demo when you click https://github.com/mitia-anah/country-quiz  
-  It was such a nice project but I faced many challenges to get it worked. The most challenging part to me was getting the questions randomly. I could not finish the score and tryAgain button
-   Thanks for this challenge, That was interesting!
